# Postmortem
I had a lot of plans regarding this project. When I first heard of this final, I had a lot of ideas to make this thing work. However none of this came to fruition, as the
class was to ambitious as asked a lot from us students. I will talk about that more in the "What went wrong" section of this postmortem. I still made a website, and made a button that makes a quiz using prompts.

# What went well:
I have a website up and running. A function I did a lot of research into to make a quiz and take the score to give results to a user. I have an about page and index/home page that works. 
I am happy about what is on the screen when the website shows up. I am glad that the final was changed due to how the class was.

# What went poorly:
I do not have an api working nor do I have a working database. This final fell apart fairly quickly as the class went on. There are so many things in this class I do not understand because when assignments were given to us, it really felt like it was asking someone who has been doing this for awhile, or at least can write this type of code for themselves. I felt lost and left behind in most assignemnts, and felt horrible turning in assignments that was just an attempt of trying to get something or anything to work. Most assignments became me turning in something after a few hours of working on it because I became frustrated not knowing what I was looking at.
This had nothing to due with our teacher, he was very patient and understood where we were all coming from, and I really appreciate him for that. Went as far as chaging ther final, so if you are readingf this Gabor thank you. But this class needs to be revised with some instruction and maybe change this to be 16 instead of 8, so that a lot more teaching can be done.

# Overall feelings
After the final change, I felt good again about turning in something as important as a final. If it wasn't changed, I would have been stressed beyond belief, as there are still so many things about this class I do not understand. 
This was very overwhelming to be very honest. I have not felt this way about a final or class before. I am unsure if I had any peers contribute to my project, I see one tried to add a css reset but I may have over written it because I was doing so may adds and commits these past few weeks getting things to work on render.
